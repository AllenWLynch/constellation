Molecular phylogenetics plays a key role in comparative genomics and has an increasingly-significant impacts on science, industry, government, public health, and society. We posit that the current phylogenetic protocol is missing two critical steps, and that their absence allows model misspecification and confirmation bias to unduly influence our phylogenetic estimates. Based on the potential offered by well-established but under-used procedures (e.g., assessment of phylogenetic assumptions and tests of goodness-of-fit), we introduce a new phylogenetic protocol that will reduce confirmation bias and increase the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates.
