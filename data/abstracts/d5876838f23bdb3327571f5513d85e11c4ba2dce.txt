Viruses have evolved complex and dynamic interactions with their host cell. In recent years we have gained insight into the expanding roles for host lipids in the virus life cycle. In particular, viruses target lipid signaling, synthesis, and metabolism to remodel their host cells into an optimal environment for their replication. This review highlights examples from different viruses that illustrate the importance of these diverse virusâ€“lipid interactions.
