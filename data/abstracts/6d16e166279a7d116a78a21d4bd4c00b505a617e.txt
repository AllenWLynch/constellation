Teaser: Our review found the average R0 for 2019-nCoV to be 3.28, which exceeds WHO estimates of 1.4 to 2.5.Here we review the basic reproduction number (R0) of the 2019-nCoV virus. R0 is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a totally na√Øve population. For R0 greater than one the number infected is likely to increase, and for R0 less than one transmission is likely to die out. The basic reproduction number is a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, indicating the risk of an infectious agent with respect to epidemic spread.
