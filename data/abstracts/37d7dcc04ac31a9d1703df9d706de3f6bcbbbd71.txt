Abstract Rotaviruses, caliciviruses, enteric adenoviruses and astroviruses are common causes of acute gastroenteritis in humans. Their particle and genome structure, classification, replication and pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical features, epidemiology, disease and outbreak management, and vaccine development are discussed. In the immunocompromized (often infected with HIV), cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, picobirnaviruses and atypical adenoviruses have also been found to be associated with diarrhoea, often chronic. Uncommon causes of diarrhoea are infections with enteroviruses, orthoreoviruses, toroviruses, coronaviruses and parvoviruses.
