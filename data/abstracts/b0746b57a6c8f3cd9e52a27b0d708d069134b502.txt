Bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, including coronaviruses (CoVs). The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) islands are a biodiversity hotspot with more than 50 bat species. Here we tested 1,099 bats belonging to 39 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles. Based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, a total of 88 bats (8.0% {+/-} 1.6%) tested positive for bat-borne coronaviruses (CoVs), with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (19.6% {+/-} 4.7%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.2% {+/-} 1.2%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that a large diversity of - and {beta}-CoVs are maintained in bat populations of the WIO, some being genetically related to human CoVs (e.g. NL63, MERS). Finally, we found a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites.
