Polyadenylation at the 3-end is a major regulator of messenger RNA and its length is known to affect nuclear export, stability and translation, among others. Only recently, strategies have emerged that allow for genome-wide poly(A) length assessment. These methods identify genes connected to poly(A) tail measurements indirectly by short-read alignment to genetic 3-ends. Concurrently Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) established full-length isoform RNA sequencing containing the entire poly(A) tail. However, assessing poly(A) length through basecalling has so far not been possible due the inability to resolve long homopolymeric stretches in ONT sequencing.\n\nHere we present tailfindr, an R package to estimate poly(A) tail length on ONT long-read sequencing data. tailfindr operates on unaligned, basecalled data. It measures poly(A) tail length from both native RNA and DNA sequencing, which makes poly(A) tail studies by full-length cDNA approaches possible for the first time. We assess tailfindrs performance across different poly(A) lengths, demonstrating that tailfindr is a versatile tool providing poly(A) tail estimates across a wide range of sequencing conditions.
