Abstract Picornaviruses (PV) and coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-stranded RNA viruses which infect millions of people worldwide each year, resulting in a wide range of clinical outcomes. As reported in this study, using high throughput screening against ∼6800 small molecules, we have identified several novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CLpro with IC50 of low μM. Interestingly, one of them equally inhibited both 3Cpro and 3CLpro from PV and CoV, respectively. Using computer modeling, the structural features of these compounds as individual and common protease inhibitors were elucidated to enhance our knowledge for developing anti-viral agents against PV and CoV.
